# chicken

Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
4 slices of ham (thinly sliced)
4 slices of Swiss cheese (or Gruyère, Emmental)
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup breadcrumbs
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon paprika (optional)
Toothpicks (for securing)
2 tablespoons butter (for frying)
2 tablespoons olive oil (for frying)
For the Sauce (optional but recommended):
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
Salt and pepper to taste
1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard (optional)

Instructions:
Prepare the Chicken:

Place the chicken breasts between two sheets of plastic wrap and gently pound them to about 1/4 inch thickness.
Season both sides of the chicken with salt, pepper, and paprika (optional).
Layer the Ham and Cheese:

Place one slice of ham and one slice of cheese on each flattened chicken breast.
Roll each chicken breast tightly, starting from the narrower end, to enclose the ham and cheese. Secure with toothpicks.
Bread the Chicken:

Set up three shallow bowls: one with flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with breadcrumbs.
Dredge each chicken roll first in flour, then dip it into the beaten egg, and finally coat it with breadcrumbs.
Cook the Chicken:

Heat the butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
Place the chicken rolls in the skillet and cook, turning occasionally, for about 8-10 minutes, or until golden brown on all sides.
Transfer the chicken rolls to a baking dish and bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C).
Prepare the Sauce (optional):

In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
Stir in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly.
Gradually whisk in the milk and bring to a simmer. Cook until thickened, about 3-5 minutes.
Stir in the Parmesan cheese and Dijon mustard (if using). Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Serve:

Once the chicken is done, remove the toothpicks. Serve the Chicken Cordon Bleu with the creamy sauce drizzled over the top.
Tips:
For a crispier texture, you can bake the breaded chicken rolls directly without frying first. Just bake for about 25-30 minutes until golden and cooked through.
You can also add Dijon mustard or garlic to the breadcrumb mixture for extra flavor.
